**Server-Sent Events (SSE)** is a server push technology enabling a server to push real-time updates to a web client over a single HTTP connection. Spring WebClient provides a reactive and non-blocking way to consume SSE from a server. Here's an explanation of how it works and an example of how to implement it.

**How Server-Sent Events Work**
**Client Requests:** The client (usually a browser or an application) makes an HTTP request to the server to establish an SSE connection.
**Server Pushes Updates:** The server keeps the HTTP connection open and continuously sends updates to the client as new data becomes available.
**Client Receives Updates:** The client listens for incoming updates and processes them in real-time.


### Using Spring WebClient to Consume SSE

Spring WebClient is part of the Spring WebFlux module and provides a non-blocking, reactive way to make HTTP requests. It can be used to consume SSE streams from a server.
